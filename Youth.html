            The Society of the Youth has played a significant role in the church since its inception. Armoured under the spiritual guidance of the Parish Priests, the Youth took the lead in organizing every ceremony in the church.<br><br>
    
            It is with great pride the elders today who were the then youth point to the fact that they served as Altar Servers for the Sacrifice of the Mass in the 1950s. Rising and falling, the youth devoted their time and labour to build the church. Especially during the 1980s and 1990s, the Church Youth Society did a very active and indelible service for the construction of the demolished church building, and they worked extensively towards the celebration of the 120-th church feast in 1990 and the 125-th Jubilee in 1995.<br><br>
            
            During those times the youth contributed to the construction of the church, not only by organizing fairs, till collections and Christmas carol concerts, but also by carrying out tedious tasks such as carrying in the sand and cement from the other side of the railway track to the church premises, wetting concrete from the day it was layed and providing security to the church grounds at night until grounds until the church was built.<br><br>
            In the year 2000, the Youth of the church organized a concert and started a fund to renovate the Catechetical School building. After a few years, the youth society didnâ€™t come to surface for a few years, and was reunited under the guidance of Rev. Fr. Thilina Samith Soysa, the then Assistant Parish Priest and is currently running under the guidance of Rev. Fr. Shameera Rodrigo.<br><br>
            
            Rev. Fr. Terrence Bodiyabaduge, the then Parish Priest re-opened the formerly closed religious shop (Kontha Kadaya) in the church, and handover its function to the Youth Society, and now they are successfully running it.<br><br>
            
            At present our youth society, which is made up of about 40 members, hopes to carry out various projects for the betterment of the church in the future, and we strongly believe that the prayers of our Patron Saint will always be there for us.
